# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This respository contains implementation of some popular algorithms in machine learning from scratch. The problem statements are
from CS 545 and CS 546 coursework along with the datasets provided in the class. The main goal of these coding assignments to understand 
working of algorithms.

### Prerequisites
Require python3 and other libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy

To run the code keep the .py code file and dataset file in the same directry. Command to run script: python name_of_file.py

#### 1) Perceptron Learning Algorithm
Download the train and test dataset from : http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Implementation of a forward pass neural network to perform handwritten digit classification.

#### 2) Neural Networks
Download the train and test dataset from : http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Implementation of a two-layer neural network (i.e, one hidden-layer) with back-propagation to perform the handwritten digit 
recognition task. 

#### 3) Bayesian Classification
Dataset is available in folder : datasets/spambase.txt
This code is a implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes model for spam detection.

#### 4) K-means clustering
Dataset is available in folder : datasets/GMM_dataset.txt
This is a implementation of standard K-Means clustering algorithm.

#### 5) Decision Tree Algorithm

This implementation contains two decision trees which are trained: 1. to predict political ”party” (democrat or republican) based on the 16 votes of the congressperson 2. a tree to predict the vote on ”physicianFeeFreeze” based on the other votes and party.
Dataset is available in folder : datasets/data.txt 
The code also contains of post-pruning and testing predictions on pruned trees.
The dataset could be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/congressional+voting+records
